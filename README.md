# 🌌 Animated Solar System

An interactive **animated solar system simulation** where users can **control the speed** of planets and celestial bodies using dropdown menus. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project provides a visual, dynamic way to understand planetary motion.

## 🪐 Features

- 🌍 **Realistic orbital animations** of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Mars.
- 🎛️ **Individual dropdown menus** to adjust the speed of:
  - ☀️ Sun rotation
  - 🌍 Earth revolution
  - 🌙 Moon orbit around Earth
  - 🔴 Mars revolution
- 💫 Smooth CSS animations and orbit paths.
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for all devices.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – structure of the solar system
- **CSS3** – animations and visual design
- **JavaScript** – dynamic speed control using dropdowns

## 🎮 Controls

Each celestial body has its own **speed dropdown menu**:
- Options like `0.5x`, `1x`, `2x`, `5x` to control rotation/revolution speed.
- Speeds update in real-time as you change dropdown values.

No buttons required — simply pick a speed from the menu!
